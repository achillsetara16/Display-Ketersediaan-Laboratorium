    <p>
      The Laboratory Availability Display System is a digital solution that displays real-time information such as the current time, room name, room usage status (occupied or vacant), and the details of ongoing or upcoming schedules. This system is designed to improve space utilization efficiency and reduce scheduling conflicts in educational or institutional environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This system was developed by the Informatics Engineering Department of Politeknik Negeri Batam as a practical solution to support better scheduling transparency and facility management. By providing accessible and up-to-date information, the system helps students, lecturers, and staff coordinate room usage more efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to create a more organized academic environment, promote smart resource usage, and support digital transformation within campus infrastructure.
